Discussion Board System

Technology Used:
- ASP.NET Web Form 4.5
- Entity Framework Code First
- Local DB
- Bootstrap
- Nuget


NOTE:
========================================================================
1. We test the application and it works as expected. Some funcionalities
   are not ready yet which are :
   - Flag answer as spam
   - Edit question
   - Admin receives notification about spam answer
   - Remove answer by Super Admin

   Functionality that is not listed in Requirements but need to be done
   and we have done it is:
   - User can view his/her question list in Dashboard.aspx page

2. Sending email to registran's email only works when the application is
   running from Mitrais network, otherwise the program will throw an ex-
   ception (we have not handled it), hardcore way to solve this problem 
   when application is opened from outside Mitrais network is comment the
   source code that is responsible in

   DiscussionBoard.BL.UserService method Register().

   Comment all codes below this one
   repository.Save(user);

3. After doing registration, user MUST ACTIVATE his/her account to be able
   to login. There are two ways to do it :
   - Click the link that is sent to his/her email (*number 2 rules)
   - Click the link that is shown immediately after the user register
